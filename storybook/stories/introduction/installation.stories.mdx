## Installation

Multiple [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/orbit-ui/packages) compose Orbit UI. Based on which type of application you're building you'll choose a different composition of packages.

For a React application, the easiest way to use Orbit UI is by installing the [@orbit-ui/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@orbit-ui/react) package.

Install the packages:

```bash
npm install @orbit-ui/react react-spring moment
```

Then import the components:

```javascript
import { Button, ... } from "semantic-ui-react";
import { DateRangePicker, MultiSelect, ... } from "@orbit-ui/react-components";
import { ClearIcon, ... } from "@orbit-ui/icons";
```

And the styles:

```css
@import "~@orbit-ui/react/[(apricot|overcast|desktop).css]";
```

If your app doesn't use React or you prefer to hand-pick a few [packages](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/orbit-ui/packages), this is also possible.

Strict *peerDependencies* are defined in every packages to ensure that dependent packages are installed together. This means that if a required package is missing during the installation, a warning will be output by your package manager.

Before installing any [React components packages](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-orbit#react-components), the [core packages](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-orbit#core) must be installed.

You can pick and choose the *core packages* to install but it is recommended to install all of them.

Install all the *core packages*:

```bash
npm install @orbit-ui/fonts @orbit-ui/css-normalize @orbit-ui/icons @orbit-ui/foundation @orbit-ui/tachyons
```

Then, import the styles:

```css
@import "~@orbit-ui/fonts";
@import "~@orbit-ui/css-normalize";
@import "~@orbit-ui/foundation[/(apricot|overcast|desktop).css]";
@import "~@orbit-ui/tachyons[/(apricot|overcast|desktop|legacy).css]";
```

Once the *core packages* are installed, you can optionally add *React component packages*.

A few options are available...

Only install the components from Semantic UI React:

```bash
npm install @orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme semantic-ui-react
```

Or install all the Orbit UI React components:

```bash
npm install @orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme @orbit-ui/react-components semantic-ui-react react-spring styled-jsx moment lodash
```

Or hand-pick a few Orbit UI React components to install:

```bash
npm install @orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme @orbit-ui/react-* semantic-ui-react styled-jsx
```

When it's done, import the components:

```javascript
import { Button, ... } from "semantic-ui-react";
import { DateRangePicker, MultiSelect, ... } from "@orbit-ui/react-components";
import { SingleDatePicker } from "@orbit-ui/react-date-pickers";
```

And import the Semantic UI theme. You can either pick & choose the specific modules that you need or import the whole theme.

For specific modules:

```css
@import "~@orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme/button.css";
@import "~@orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme/checkbox.css";
```

For the whole theme:

```css
@import "~@orbit-ui/semantic-ui-theme";
```
