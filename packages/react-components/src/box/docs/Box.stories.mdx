# Box

<Tagline>A box is a general purpose component that can be used to compose new components or render a component into a slot.</Tagline>

<ComponentInfo
    usage={"import { Box } from \"@orbit-ui/react-components\""}
    githubPath="/packages/react-components/src/box/src"
/>

## Usage

As the design system evolve, we plan on adding more features which will justify using a box component instead of a native DOM element. Therefore, we do recommend you start using it as early as possible even if at the moment it only helps with [slots](?path=/docs/slots--page).

### Default

A default box.

<Preview>
    <Story name="default">
        <Box>Enjoy space like never before.</Box>
    </Story>
</Preview>

### As DOM element

A box component will render as a `div` element by default. You can change this by using the `as` prop.

<Preview>
    <Story name="dom element">
        <Box as="span">Enjoy space like never before.</Box>
    </Story>
</Preview>

## API

<ComponentInfo
    usage={"import { Box } from \"@orbit-ui/react-components\""}
    compact
/>

<ArgsTable of={InnerBox} />
