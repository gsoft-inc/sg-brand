/*
- Might need an additional useRestoreFocus hook
- This might have to become a component instead. Something like FocusTrap or FocusScope or FocusLock.

- For example, for a ComboBox, you should be able to focus back on the trigger.

- If called FocusScope or useFocusScope maybe we could also add to trigger the first focusable element on open
         (with a config to disable it or make sure it could be overriden somehow if someone needs to focus a specific element)

- Could also be called useFocusLock - FocusLock
