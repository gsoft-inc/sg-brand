## Add a new component

Adding a new component package involve a few extra steps. Before you go forward with this section, make sure you read and followed the [Add a new packages to the monorepo](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#add-a-new-package-to-the-monorepo) section. 

- [Guidelines](#component-guidelines)
- [Write storybook stories](#write-storybook-stories)
- [Write tests](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#testing)
- [Update the documentation](#update-the-documentation)
- [Include the component in the bundle](#include-the-component-in-the-bundle)

### Guidelines

Make sure you read and understand the following [guidelines](#component-guidelines) before writing a component.

### Write storybook stories

As mentionned in the [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md), Storybook is use to *develop*, *document* and *test* a component.

To develop and document, we leverage the [CSF](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/) and [MDX](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/mdx-syntax/) features of Storybook.

To test, we rely on a third party called [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/) that fully integrate with Storybook to provide visual testing capabilities.

#### Develop and document

Development stories are written for 2 purposes:

- For the developper to test a component use case in a isolated story during the development lifecycle.
- For the design team to try the component behaviors.

Documentation stories are written... well for documentation purpose!

To define a story once for development and documentation a story must be written with [CSF](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/component-story-format/) in an `*.stories.mdx` file. The name of the file should match the component name.

A story must:

- Be located in the `Components` top level section of the Storybook navigation menu.
- The second level segment must be the capitalized name of the component.

Here's an exemple for the date range picker component:

```jsx
// Button.stories.mdx

<Meta title="Components/Button" />
```

A component stories must provide:

- A story named *default* that render the component default state.

The stories must be located in a `docs` folder next to the `src` folder of your component. Storybook is configured to load the following component stories: `packages/react-components/src/*/docs/**.stories.mdx`.

```
/packages
    /react-components
        /components
            /buttons
                /docs
                    Button.stories.mdx
                /src
```

#### Tests

##### Visual Regression

Tests stories are written to validate the specifications of a component with automated visual tests. The specifications stories are validated [every night](https://circleci.com/gh/gsoft-inc) with [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/) for visual regression issues.

Storybook is a fantastic tool for visual testing because a story is essentially a test specification. When it does make sense, multiple specifications can be bundled together to save on snapshots.

Specifications stories must be written with the [storiesOf API](https://storybook.js.org/docs/formats/storiesof-api/) in a `*.chroma.jsx` file.

A specifications story must:

- Be located in the `Chromatic` top level section of the Storybook navigation menu.
- The second level segment must be the capitalized name of the component (same as the development stories).

Here's an example:

```javascript
// Button.chroma.jsx

import { paramsBuilder, storiesOfBuilder } from "@stories/utils";

function stories(segment) {
    return storiesOfBuilder(module, "Chromatic/Button")
        .segment(segment)
        .parameters(
            paramsBuilder()
                .build()
            )
        .build();
}

stories("/segment")
    .add("story-name",
         () =>
            ...
    )
```

The stories must be located in a `tests/chromatic` folder next to the `src` folder of your component. Storybook is configured to load the following tests specifications: `packages/react-components/src/*/tests/chromatic/**.chroma.[jsx|tsx]`.

```
/packages
    /react-components
        /components
            /buttons
                /src
                /tests
                    /chromatic
                        Button.chroma.jsx
```

For more information about the Storybook automated visual tests workflow, read the following [blog post](https://blog.hichroma.com/the-delightful-storybook-workflow-b322b76fd07) and the following [introduction to visual testing](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/visual-testing-handbook/react/en/introduction/).

##### Interaction tests

Sometimes we need to test how a component changes in response to a user interaction. Visual testing tools like Chromatic are awesome to tests known states but can't really help to mock and validate user interactions.

To do so, we rely on [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).

Interaction tests must:

- Be written  in a `*.test.[jsx|tsx]` file.
- Be located in a `tests/jest` folder next to the `src` folder of your component.

```
/packages
    /react-components
        /components
            /buttons
                /src
                /tests
                    /jest
                        Button.test.jsx
```

Here's an example:

```javascript
// Button.test.jsx

test("call onChange when the button is selected", () => {
    ....
});
```

## Component guidelines

Every Orbit UI custom components must share a consistent API and a similar design. Please read carefully the following guidelines before you develop a new component or update an existing one.

### Design

#### Functional components

All components should be developed as functional components.

#### Hooks

All components should leverage React hooks.

#### Styling

An Orbit UI component shouldn't use Tachyons classes.

All styling should be done with native CSS. Custom classes should use [Orbit UI foundation CSS variables](https://orbit.sharegate.design/?path=/docs/getting-started-foundation--page) when available.

#### Controlled & Auto-controlled

A component should always be develop to offer a [controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html) and [auto-controlled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) usage. 

A *controlled* component gives a lot of flexibility to the consumer and is well fit for a lot of use cases but also involve additional code. We believe a component should be flexible but also painless to use. That's why a component should also offer an *auto-controlled* mode for basic use cases who don't requires controlling the props.

#### Never stop event propagation

A component shouldn't stop the propagation of an event. Instead, other parts of the code should determine whether or not it should handle the event.

For more information, read the following [blog post](https://css-tricks.com/dangers-stopping-event-propagation/).

#### Spread props

Unhandled props should always be spread on the root element of the component.

```jsx
function MyComponent({ className, children ...rest }) {
    return (
        <div className={className} {...rest}>
            {children}
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Developer experience

#### Props and Typings

Every component and functions should provide static typings with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). For most required props, instead of defining the prop as required, you should instead provide a default value.

### Naming

#### Event handlers props

Event handler props should be prefix by `on` and be in the present tense.

Ex:

- Prefer `onChange` to `onChanged`
- Prefer `onItemClick` to `onItemClicked`

#### Boolean props

A boolean prop shouldn't be prefix with `is`.

Ex:

- Prefer `open` to `isOpen`
- Prefer `disabled` to `isDisabled`

#### Prefer simpler props name

When there is no possible *ambiguities*, prefer a simpler prop name.

For example, prefer `icon` to `inputIcon`.

#### Initial values props name

Auto-controlled components will usually expose initial values props. Those props should be prefix with `default`.

Ex:

- `defaultOpen`
- `defaultStartDate`
- `defaultValues`

#### Accessibility

All components should follow [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/).

## Babel

The components are transpiled to ES5 compatible code using [babel](https://babeljs.io/). The [babel configuration](/babel.config.js) is located at the root of the *react-components* package.

The current configuration use [babel-plugin-transform-runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-runtime) to optimize the file size of the components.
