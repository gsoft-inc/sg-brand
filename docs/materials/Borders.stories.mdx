# Borders

You will find most of the documentation for borders utilities on [Tachyons website](https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/borders/).

Keep in mind though that the borders colors utilities have been replaced to match [Orbit Design colors](?path=/docs/colors--page).

For an exhaustive list of utilities classes for borders **including our customizations**, please refer to the [Tachyons section](#tachyons) below.

## Utilities

Most of Tachyons original border colors classes have been replaced by classes matching [Orbit Design colors](?path=/docs/colors--page). You shouldn't have to use Tachyons original border colors classes very often.

### Foundation colors

To style borders with any colors of Orbit Design, use the following classes:

- `b--[color-name|product-name]-[50-900]` (ex. `b--sunray-50`, `b--apricot-50`)
- `hover-b--[color-name|product-name]-[50-900]` (ex. `hover-b--sunray-50`, `hover-b--apricot-50`)
- `focus-b--[color-name|product-name]-[50-900]` (ex. `focus-b--sunray-50`, `focus-b--apricot-50`)

### Primary

Whenever you can, prefer using primary classes over your product color classes:

- `b--primary-[50-900]` (ex. `b--primary-50`)
- `hover-b--primary-[50-900]` (ex. `hover-b--primary-50`)
- `focus-b--primary-[50-900]` (ex. `focus-b--primary-50`)
