# Motion

<Tagline>Motion is a way to convey a message without telling a word, from giving a visual hint to a user about what just happened to rewarding him.</Tagline>

## Utilities

Our motion utilities consists of two set of values, *durations* as well as *easings*.

### Duration

Timing is everything. Durations helps convey a message and makes transitions smooth and responsive. Different durations should be used for different cases. A chart is available down below to help making an informed desicion while designing animations.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Duration", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["t1", "100ms"],
        ["t2", "200ms"],
        ["t3", "300ms"],
        ["t4", "500ms"],
        ["t5", "800ms"]
    ]}
/>

### Easings

Easings adds life to motion, providing natural rests, they set the mood of an animation. Orbit provides 3 pre-defined easings, each having their use.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Easing", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "400px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["productive", "cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)"],
        ["focus", "cubic-bezier(0.46, 0.03, 0.52, 0.96)"],
        ["expressive", "cubic-bezier(0.72, -0.66, 0.15, 1.5)"]
    ]}
/>

#### Productive

Productive animations are not in the way, they quickly change from one state to another.

#### Focus

Focus animations are designed to draw the userâ€™s attention on what changed, in order to let them move on with their next task.

#### Expressive

Expressive animations are meant to give a sense of completeness or resolution to the user. Use them wisely.

## Utilities

### Variables

Reusables durations and easings are exposed through CSS Custom Properties(aka variables).

### Durations

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Variable", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Example", headerStyle: { width: "500px" } }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["100ms", "--o-ui-timing-1", <MotionSample duration="100"/>],
        ["200ms", "--o-ui-timing-2", <MotionSample duration="200"/>],
        ["300ms", "--o-ui-timing-3", <MotionSample duration="300"/>],
        ["500ms", "--o-ui-timing-4", <MotionSample duration="500"/>],
        ["800ms", "--o-ui-timing-5", <MotionSample duration="800"/>]
    ]}
/>

### Easings

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "350px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Variable", headerStyle: { width: "250px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Example", headerStyle: { width: "300px" } }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)", "--o-ui-easing-productive", <MotionSample duration="500" easing="(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)"/>],
        ["cubic-bezier(0.46, 0.03, 0.52, 0.96)", "--o-ui-easing-focus", <MotionSample duration="500" easing="(0.46, 0.03, 0.52, 0.96)"/>],
        ["cubic-bezier(0.72, -0.66, 0.15, 1.5)", "--o-ui-easing-expressive", <MotionSample duration="500" easing="(0.72, -0.66, 0.15, 1.5)"/>]
    ]}
/>
