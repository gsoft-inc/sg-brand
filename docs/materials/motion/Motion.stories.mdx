# Motion

<Tagline>Motion is a way to convey a message without telling a word, from giving a visual hint to a user about what just happened to rewarding him.</Tagline>

## Usage

Our motion utilities consists of two set of values, *durations* as well as *easings*. Both variables can be combined in transition as well in CSS animations to set the tone of an animation/transition(animation is used interchangeably with transition from now on).


Durations and easings can be refered to in CSS [transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) as well as in CSS [animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) declarations.

In transition declaration :

```css
.tease {
    transition: color var(--o-ui-easing-duration-1) var(--o-ui-easing-focus);
}
```

In animation declaration :

```css
@keyframes tease-animation  {
    0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(1.2);
    }
    100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1);
    }
}

.tease {
    animation: tease-animation var(--o-ui-easing-duration-2) var(--o-ui-easing-productive);
}
```

### Duration

Orbit exposes 5 [durations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-duration), they help convey a message and makes animations smooth and responsive.

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Duration", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["t1", "100ms"],
        ["t2", "200ms"],
        ["t3", "300ms"],
        ["t4", "500ms"],
        ["t5", "800ms"]
    ]}
/>

### Easings

[Easings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) denotes a mathematical function that describes the rate at which a numerical value changes. They adds life to motion, providing natural rests, they set the mood of an animation. Orbit provides 3 pre-defined easings, each having their use.

#### Productive

Used in animations that are not in the way, they quickly change from one state to another.

#### Focus

Used in animations that are designed to draw the userâ€™s attention on what changed, in order to let them move on with their next task.

#### Expressive

Used in animations that are meant to give a sense of completeness or resolution to the user. Use them wisely.

    columns={[
        { title: "Easing", headerStyle: { width: "200px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "400px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["productive", "cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)"],
        ["focus", "cubic-bezier(0.46, 0.03, 0.52, 0.96)"],
        ["expressive", "cubic-bezier(0.72, -0.66, 0.15, 1.5)"]
    ]}

## Utilities

### Variables

Durations and easings are exposed through CSS Custom Properties(aka variables).

### Durations

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "150px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Variable", headerStyle: { width: "250px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["100ms", "--o-ui-easing-duration-1"],
        ["200ms", "--o-ui-easing-duration-2"],
        ["300ms", "--o-ui-easing-duration-3"],
        ["500ms", "--o-ui-easing-duration-4"],
        ["800ms", "--o-ui-easing-duration-5"]
    ]}
/>

### Easings

<Table
    columns={[
        { title: "Value", headerStyle: { width: "350px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" },
        { title: "Variable", headerStyle: { width: "250px" }, rowClassName: "code f7 o-90" }
    ]}
    rows={[
        ["cubic-bezier(0.46, 0.03, 0.52, 0.96)", "--o-ui-easing-focus"],
        ["cubic-bezier(0.22, 0.61, 0.36, 1)", "--o-ui-easing-productive"],
        ["cubic-bezier(0.58, 0.01, 0.15, 1.5)", "--o-ui-easing-expressive"]
    ]}
