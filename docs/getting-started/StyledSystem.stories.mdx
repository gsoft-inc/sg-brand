# Styled System

In order to achieve a consistent UI, Orbit lets you quickly build custom UI components with constraint-based [style props](/story/style-props--page) based on scales defined in a [theme](/story/theming--page), defined by our product designers.

Styled system let's you quickly set responsive _font-size_, _margin_, _padding_, _width_, and more on a component. All this following standards defined in a theme object provided by Orbit and customizable, to an extent, by you.

<Preview>
    <Box
    fontSize={6}
    fontWeight="3"
    padding={3}
    marginBottom={3}
    color="white"
    borderRadius={3}
    backgroundColor="primary-5">
    Hello World
    </Box>
</Preview>

All style props are discovererable with TypeScript intellisense as well as the values defined by the theme, no more guessing.
