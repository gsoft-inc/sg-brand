# As function

Previously, all Orbit components were accepting an `as` prop. This feature have always be useful to handle use cases were you need to change the underlying element type or integrate Orbit with an external library like [React router](https://reactrouter.com/).

```jsx
import { Link as ReactRouterLink } from "react-router-dom";
import { TextLink } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";

<TextLink as={ReactRouterLink} to="/home">Home</TextLink>
```

Since we introduced TypeScript, the `as` prop has proven to be difficult. Dynamic typings based on a React prop value is not Typescript best friend.

To mitigate the problem, we choose to deprecated the `as` prop in favor of an `as(baseComponent, asComponent)` function. The new `as()` function return a new component which render the provided `baseComponent` as `asComponent` and merge the typings of both components.

Specify a new underlying element type:

```jsx
import { as, TextLink } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";

const TextLinkAsButton = as(TextLink, "button");

<TextLinkAsButton onClick={() => window.location.href = "/home"}>Home</TextLinkAsButton>
```

Integrate with a third party:

```jsx
import { as, TextLink } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";
import { Link as ReactRouterLink } from "react-router-dom";

const RouterTextLink = as(TextLink, ReactRouterLink);

<RouterTextLink to="/home">Home</RouterTextLink>
```
