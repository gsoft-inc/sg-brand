# Slots

Slots solve a variety of use cases by allowing a component to offer multiple layouts in a declarative way.

It's done by giving a component the ability to offer *named placeholders* which could then be filled by the component consumer to achieve the final layout.

For more information about the *concept of slots*, have a look at web components slots on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots#adding_flexibility_with_slots).

In Orbit, slots are defined [implicitly](#implicit-slots) or [explicitly](#explicit-slots) and are fulfilled through the component children.

In the following example, the `<Text>` component implicitly fulfill the `text` slot and the `<LightbulbIcon>` component explicitly fulfill the `end-icon` slot.

```jsx
<Button variant="outline" color="secondary">
    <Text>Cutoff</Text>
    <LightbulbIcon slot="end-icon" />
</Button>
```

To identify which slots are available for a component, refer to the API section of the component. [Have a look at the button component slots](?path=/docs/button--default-story#button-1).

## Implicit slots

*Slotables* Orbit components come with a default slot name.

An `<Icon>` component will implicitly fulfill an `icon` slot and a `<Button>` component will implicitly fulfill a `button` slot, etc..

To use an implicit slot, declare a component having a default slot as a children of a component accepting the given slot.

```jsx
<Button variant="outline" color="secondary">
    <LightbulbIcon />
    <Text>Cutoff</Text>
</Button>
```

You can define an implicit slot on a custom component by using the `slot` function.

```js
import { slot } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";

export const MyComponent = slot("name-of-the-slot-to-fulfill-by-default", () => (
    <Box>A custom component</Box>
));
```

## Explicit slots

An explicit slot is defined by specifying the `slot` prop on a component declaration.

```jsx
<Button variant="outline" color="secondary">
    <Text>Cutoff</Text>
    <LightbulbIcon slot="end-icon" />
</Button>
```

For native HTML elements, instead of specifying an explicit slot directly on the native element, we do recommend you use the [`<Box>`](?path=/docs/box--default-story) component to prevent rendering a `slot` attribute on the element.

```jsx
<Card>
    <H1>SpaceX delays launch of South Korean military satellite</H1>
    <Box slot="content">SpaceX postponed the upcoming launch of a South Korean military satellite Monday (July 13), due to hardware issues with the Falcon 9 rocket.</Box>
    <Box slot="footer">Copyright @2021</Box>
</Card>
```

> A component default slot can be overrided by defining an explicit slot.
