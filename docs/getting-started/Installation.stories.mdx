# Installation

Multiple [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/orbit-ui/packages) compose Orbit. We simplify the installation process by creating a bundle package called [@sharegate/orbit-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sharegate/orbit-ui) so you can install Orbit by adding a single package to your app.

> We take for granted you already installed [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom). If you haven't, **you'll get a warning at installation**.

### Install packages

To install Orbit, open a terminal at the root of your project workspace and execute the following command:

<PackageInstallationSnippet packageName="bundle" />

The command will install all Orbit packages in your app `node_modules` folder.

### Import styles

Orbit styles includes the [ShareGate font](?path=/docs/typography--page), a [CSS bootstrap](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/sg-orbit/tree/master/packages/css/src) and of course the components styles.

To import Orbit styles add the following import statement to your root stylesheet:

```css
@import "~@sharegate/orbit-ui/index.css";
```

### Bootstrap your app

Instead of harcoding the foundation values in Orbit, we choose to implement a [theming system](?path=/story/styled-system--page#theming) which allow apps to easily provide their foundation values to Orbit.

The theming system introduced a concept of theme object. To bootstrap Orbit, you'll need to build your own theme object or import a pre-constructed one from Orbit. The theme object will be used to create the foundation variables with `createThemeVars()` and define a `<ThemeProvider>` at the root of your application.

Here's an example of how to bootstrap an app with a pre-constructed ShareGate Apricot theme object:

```jsx
import { createThemeVars, ApricotTheme, ThemeProvider } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

createThemeVars([ApricotTheme]);

render(
    <ThemeProvider theme={ApricotTheme} colorScheme="light">
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### Start building

You're all set! You can start building your app with Orbit:

```jsx
import { Div, Text } from "@sharegate/orbit-ui";

export const App = () => (
  <Div backgroundColor="sunray-10">
    <Text color="cloud-5">Hello World!</Text>
  </Div>
);
```

## Icons

[Orbit icons](?path=/docs/icon-gallery--page) React components depends on [`@svgr/webpack`](https://react-svgr.com/docs/getting-started/) to transform SVG icons files into React components. To setup `@svgr/webpack` you can use [babel-plugin-named-asset-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-named-asset-import) to export the icons components as [named exports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) and leverage [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/).

```javascript
{
    plugins: [
        [
            "babel-plugin-named-asset-import",
            {
                loaderMap: {
                    svg: {
                        "ReactComponent": "@svgr/webpack?-svgo,+ref![path]"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    ]
}
```
